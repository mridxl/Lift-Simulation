# Lift Simulation  

A web app that simulates lift mechanics, allowing users to visualize and interact with elevator movements. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project explores OOP concepts, CSS transitions, and JS objects/prototypes. This is my solution for [RDS lift simulation assignment](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Lift-Simulation)

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [Lift Simulation](https://mridxl-lift-simulation.vercel.app/)  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  

âœ… **Dynamic Input** â€“ Users can specify the number of floors and lifts.  
âœ… **Interactive UI** â€“ Floors display call buttons, and lifts respond to requests.  
âœ… **Realistic Lift Behavior** â€“ Lifts move intelligently to requested floors.  
âœ… **Smooth Animations** â€“ Doors open (2.5s), close (2.5s), and lift moves at 2s per floor.  
âœ… **Optimized Lift Allocation** â€“ Lifts are assigned efficiently to minimize wait times.  
âœ… **Stops at Multiple Requests** â€“ Lifts stop at every floor where they were called.  
âœ… **Mobile-Friendly** â€“ Responsive design for a seamless experience on all devices.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes  

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of:  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**  
- **Handling state using JS objects and prototypes**  
- **CSS transitions and animations for smooth UI interactions**  
- **Optimizing lift movement logic for realistic simulation**  

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works  

1. Users enter the number of floors and lifts.  
2. A UI is generated with buttons on each floor and lift indicators.  
3. Clicking a floor button calls the nearest available lift.  
4. The lift moves, stops at requested floors, and opens/closes doors accordingly.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements  

- **Better Lift Allocation Algorithm** â€“ Optimize for multiple simultaneous requests.  
- **Sound Effects & UI Enhancements** â€“ Improve user experience.  
- **Local Storage Support** â€“ Save state between refreshes.
